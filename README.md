# AI Evals

Trying to bring a tiny bit of rigor to AI deep research tool evaluations.

## Evaluations

### 01. Laneway Houses

"Find out why some laneway/coach houses can be sold on their own in Vancouver and some can't"

A good answer would touch on:

- character retention program
- coach house stuff (which I believe is RT only)

**Claude 4.0 Sonnet:** gets the broad strokes right but makes up some stuff about the pre-laneway-house era (totally unrelated CityHallWatch citation, oof) and mistakenly thinks the character house program ended when it didn't.

Not great.

**Claude 4.0 Opus:**

"Examples demonstrate viability but limited application" section is incorrect. But otherwise pretty good summary of laneways. Doesn't touch on the RT coach house thing.
